Meshtastic Cases and other useful tools.

Depending on your printer, you may need to print each piece from the large complete STL file. You will also want the Reset Button and the button cover.

Parts Used - You will need a surface mount momentary switch for the user button. Similar or same as a black solder on click button. (Picture soon)

Hot glue the screen into the front cover. You will want a I2C 1.3" 132x64 Screen found on Amazon.com or other site that has 4 pins. Take note of the pins on the screen and the RAK 19007 board because some screen manufactures switch the VCC and GRD pins. WARNING: Plugging in the screen incorectly can kill it for good. Pressing to hard on the corner of the bare screen can kill it for good. These are cheap for a reason but dont waste your money.

I do alot of custom cables just to try and build a production ready item for Etsy someday, but you can solder all the parts and skip the connectors. Do not glue the button cover on until you make sure its working. I did this and tossed an entire print.
